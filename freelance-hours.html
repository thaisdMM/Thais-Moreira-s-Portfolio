      <h3>Homepage</h3>
<p>
  The homepage displays the FreelanceHours logo, along with links to post a project, search for a project, and understand how the platform works. It includes a featured image, as well as project listings showing whether the project is open or closed, the project name, the publication date, and the deadline. Additionally, the technologies used and the name of the project creator are displayed.

<h3>Accepting Proposals</h3>
<p>
  On the “Accepting Proposals” page, the title highlights that proposals are open. Below it, the project name, a brief description, publication date, a submission link, and a countdown timer until the deadline are displayed. The page also lists the technologies used in the project and the creator's name. On the right side, a ranking of submitted proposals is shown, detailing the applicants' emails, submission times, and estimated hours to complete the project. There is also an option to load more proposals if needed.

<h3>Submit a Proposal</h3>
<p>
  When selecting “Submit a Proposal,” users access a form requiring their email and the number of monthly hours they intend to work on the project. The form includes a privacy policy agreement, which must be accepted before submission. Once submitted, the proposal is saved in the database, and the ranking board is immediately updated to display the applicant’s position based on their email and proposed hours.
