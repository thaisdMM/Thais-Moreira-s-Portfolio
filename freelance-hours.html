      <h3>Homepage</h3>
      <p>
        On the homepage, we have the Freelance Hours logo, a link to post a
        project, another to search for a project, and another explaining how the
        project works. There is also a photo. On the homepage, we also display
        whether a project is closed or open, the project name, the date it was
        published, and the closing time. Additionally, it includes the
        technologies used and the name of the person who posted the project.

      <h3>Accepting Proposals</h3>
      <p>
        On the “Accepting Proposals” page, the title indicates that proposals
        are open, followed by the project name, a short description, the
        publication date, a link to submit a proposal, and a countdown showing
        the remaining time until the deadline. The page also lists the
        technologies used in the project and the name of the person who posted
        it. On the right side, there is a ranking of submitted proposals,
        displaying the applicants emails, the time since submission, and the
        estimated hours to complete the project. If needed, there is an option
        to load more proposals.
